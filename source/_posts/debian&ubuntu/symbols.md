title: symbols files
---

Symbols files provide a way of tracking the exported symbols of a library, which helps in fine-tuning the library dependencies generated by dpkg-shlibdeps and tracking (partially) binary compatibility.



### Using symbolshelper in your package

1. add pkg-kde-tools to your Build-Depends

2. change the debian/rules file:

   ```
   %:
   	dh $@ --with pkgkde_symbolshelper
   ```

### Creating a symbols file

1. build the package

2. run the follow commands:

   ```
   pkgkde-gensymbols -plibfoo1 -v1.7 -Osymbols.amd64 -edebian/libfoo1/usr/lib/libfoo.so.1
   pkgkde-symbolshelper create -o debian/libfoo1.symbols -v 1.7 symbols.amd64
   ```

   

# Updating multiple symbols files

In source packages that provide multiple binary library packages:

pkgkde-symbolshelper batchpatch -v 1.8 buildlog

You can get the symbols for different archs including those from www.ports.debian.org all at once by running inside the top-level source directory the getbuildlog script as provided by the devscripts package:

getbuildlog peony last

pkgkde-symbolshelper batchpatch -v 1.8 foo_1.8-1*.build
